## How to remember the planets:

```
my very easy method, just say: "uckie noodles please"
```

Reminds you that the planets are:
```
mercury, venus, earth, mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune and pluto
```
## Scaling the planets

Now we need to know how fast they go, so we can scale the planets

## days in a year

Planet | days in a year
--- | ---: 
mercury | 88
venus | 225 
earth | 365
mars | 687
jupiter | 4,300
saturn | 11,000
uranus | 31,000
neptune | 60,200
pluto | 90,500

Scale by multiplying standard orbit by `number of days in an earth year / number of days in a year`
